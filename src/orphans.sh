# Description: This script displays processes that might be orphans,
#              i.e. processes whose parent process is not running.
# Usage: chmod +x orphans.sh && ./orphans.sh
# Example: ./orphans.sh  displays a list of processes that might be orphans.

# Create temporary files for process data.

# Cleanup function to remove temporary files.
